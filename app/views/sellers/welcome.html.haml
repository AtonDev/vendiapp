            Choose an item and make a Vendi-bid.
            
          %p.lead Look through our database, and submit a Vendi-bid for an item you know you can sell. Your Vendi-bid is the amount the owner expects to make once you sell the item. If your Vendi-bid is accepted, you are free to sell the item however you want.

              Find a buyer.
            %p.lead Sell the item, on the marketplace of your choice, for any amount greater than your Vendi-bid. Once you sell the item, send us a cash amount equal to your Vendi-bid (plus $6.00 for shipping), and the item gets shipped to the buyer.
